## LIFTed VFO – Case Study, Platform Overview, Security Posture, and Statement of Work (SOW)

### 1) Executive Summary
LIFTed VFO is an AI‑powered Virtual Family Office that unifies client onboarding, legal document workflows, CRM, knowledge retrieval, calendaring, and payments into one secure platform. This document serves both as a product case study (what users can do), a technical deep dive (how it works), a security overview (how it’s protected), and a Statement of Work (what it takes to build and operate).

### 3) Product Modules and Screens

3.1 Client Portal
- Dashboard Overview: Personalized greeting, upcoming consults, and action cards.
- Book a Consult: Public and authenticated workflows; creates CRM records.
- Vault: File upload with type/size guardrails; documents indexed for RAG retrieval.
- Matters: List and detail pages with stage tracking (“New”, “Booked”, “Signed”, “In Process”, “Completed”).
- Questionnaires: Guided data collection; stored in JSON fields for flexibility.

3.2 Advisor/Admin Console
- Client Directory (ClientsView): Search clients, drill into matters and vault.
- CRM Admin: Create/modify contacts/matters; custom field mapping (FieldMapping); conflict checks.
- Pipelines Admin: Define pipeline stages and track conversion.
- Vault Admin: Document curation and permissions.
- Nurture Admin: Future‑friendly rule-based automation; logging for actions.
- Site Builder Admin: Basic CMS controls (pages, content sections) consistent with global theme.

3.3 SuperAdmin Operations
- User Management: Create advisors, reset passwords, toggle is_active, change roles (Admin/Advisor), enforce 2FA.
- Link Clients to Advisors: Tie existing clients to advisors; update ownership as staff changes.
- Platform Settings: Restrict config/test endpoints; run safe, rate‑limited migrations with audit trails.

3.4 Knowledge & RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Ask‑Docs (RAG): Query the document corpus by client/entity; responses include citations (doc/page) and short excerpts.
- Insights: Summaries across all docs for an entity (deadlines, obligations, potential risks) with clear disclaimers.
- Guardrails: System prompts prevent instruction-following from retrieved content; answers remain source‑grounded.

3.5 Calendar & Payments
- Google Calendar: Admin can initiate consent; URL‑based hosted flow; booking UX aligned to advisor availability.
- LawPay: Hosted pages for operating/trust accounts; no raw card data touches the app; keys set via environment.

### 4) Behind the Scenes (Technical Architecture)

4.1 Frontend
- Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite. Deployed as static assets (Render static site) and cached via CDN.
- Routing: Role-based protected routes; Admin/Client/SuperAdmin experiences.
- Security: No access_token persisted in localStorage; app relies on secure HttpOnly cookie sessions; DOMPurify ensures safe HTML rendering.

4.2 Backend
- Stack: FastAPI (Python). Services include Auth, CRM, Legal/Vault, Agent/RAG, SuperAdmin/Admin, GoogleAuth.
- Auth: JWT signed server‑side; secure cookie (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax) set/cleared at login/logout.
- RBAC: Role checks at route entry; admin endpoints require session + Admin/SuperAdmin; optional IP allowlist.
- Rate Limiting: Login endpoint protects against brute force; per‑IP and per‑username constraints.
- 2FA: TOTP enforced when enabled; SuperAdmin can enroll via endpoint; UI supports OTP challenge.
- Observability: `/healthz` liveness, `/readyz` DB ping, request ID middleware, optional Sentry integration.

4.3 Data & Documents
- Postgres: Users (roles, advisor links), Contacts/Matters/Intakes, Document metadata, FieldMapping.
- Document Processing: PDF/DOCX/TXT extracted to text, split into chunks, indexed for retrieval.
- Upload Rules: MIME allowlist (PDF/DOCX), streaming cap (≤20MB), 413/415 for violations.

4.4 RAG Pipeline
- Vector Store: Metadata with file name, entity ID, doc type; search returns top‑K with scores.
- Prompt Policy: System prompt forbids executing instructions from retrieved content; answers must cite sources.
- Safety: Model boundaries defined; injection attempts mitigated by policy and testable acceptance criteria.

4.5 DevOps & CI
- Render: Backend (FastAPI/uvicorn) and static frontend; Alembic migrations run at start.
- Docker: Multi‑stage builds, minimized runtime, non‑root user for backend; nginx static for frontend.
- CI Security: Bandit, pip‑audit, npm audit (prod), Trivy FS; extendable to image scans/SBOM.

---

### 5) Security Posture (Implemented)
- HTML Sanitization: DOMPurify component (`SafeHtml`), removal of direct dangerous HTML inserts.
- Upload Hardening: MIME allowlist; streaming reads/writes; size enforcement; defensive error codes.
- CORS & Secrets: Prod origin restriction; enumerated methods; fail‑fast if `SECRET_KEY`/`DATABASE_URL` missing.
- Admin RBAC: Session‑based auth, role checks, rate‑limited admin tools, IP allowlist, and audit logging.
- PII/Secrets Redaction: Global logger filter masks emails/tokens; admin audit payloads redacted.
- Health/Telemetry: `/healthz`, `/readyz`, request IDs; Sentry optional via DSN.
- Alembic Migrations: Framework in place; runtime DDL disabled in prod; `alembic upgrade head` on startup.

5.1 Security Posture (Environment/Edge Actions)
- Provider Token Encryption (0.2): Set `APP_DEK`, run backfill, verify ciphertext/IV, drop plaintext.
- CSP at Edge (1.4): Add report‑only CSP in Render headers; monitor; switch to enforcing CSP.
- WebAuthn MFA (Optional): Extend TOTP with hardware‑backed key support.

### 6) User Stories / Use Cases (Representative)

6.1 Client – Onboarding and Secure Collaboration
1) I can register/login (with 2FA if enabled), see my dashboard, and view upcoming consults.
2) I can upload my trust documents and tax records to my secure vault.
3) I can book time with my advisor from available slots.
4) I can complete questionnaires and see my matters’ status.

6.2 Advisor – Full Client Lifecycle
1) I can create a client and a matter, and share a secure upload link.
2) I can review uploaded documents, index them for retrieval, and ask RAG a question with citations.
3) I can track pipeline stages (New → Booked → Signed → In Process → Completed).
4) I can initiate payments via LawPay and run calendar flows for scheduling.

6.3 SuperAdmin – Governance & Security
1) I can add an advisor, enable 2FA, and link clients under that advisor.
2) I can run safe admin migrations and restrict config probes.
3) I can set a CSP header at the edge and apply encryption backfill policies.

### 7) Implementation Notes (By Area)

7.1 Authentication & Sessions
- FastAPI issues JWT; cookie flags: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax, max‑age.
- Frontend Axios set to `withCredentials: true` to rely on cookie sessions (no token headers).
- Logout explicitly clears session cookie server‑side.

7.2 RBAC & Admin Tools
- Admin endpoints check session + role; optional IP allowlist via `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST`.
- Audit logging includes request ID, user metadata, action, and redacted details.

7.3 RAG
- Vector search contextualizes prompts; “treat retrieved content as reference, not instruction.”
- Answers include citations and excerpts; injection tests are planned as acceptance criteria.

7.4 Uploads & Vault
- Streaming to disk with size counter protects memory; allowed types prevent parser exploits.
- Document metadata, chunk counts, and indexing outcomes stored for traceability.

7.5 Observability & CI
- Health/readiness endpoints permit shallow vs. DB‑level checks.
- CI scans fail on high/critical vulnerabilities for early warning.
