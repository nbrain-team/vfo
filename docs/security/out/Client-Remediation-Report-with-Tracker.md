### Priority 0

#### 0.1 Replace browser tokens with secure cookie sessions
- Status: In Progress

- Notes/Follow-up: {{NOTES_0_1}}

#### 0.2 Encrypt provider refresh tokens at rest
- Status: In Progress
- What we changed: Added encrypted columns and admin backfill/drop endpoints. Awaiting APP_DEK and staging backfill run, then drop plaintext.
- Notes/Follow-up: Set APP_DEK (>=32 bytes) in Render; run backfill; verify; drop plaintext.
