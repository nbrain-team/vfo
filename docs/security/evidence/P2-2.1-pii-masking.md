### Evidence P2-2.1: PII masking and selective encryption

Implemented:
- Admin audit logs redact sensitive fields (email, tokens, etc.).
- Masking strategy: emails partially masked; tokens show only prefix/suffix.
- Global logging redaction filter applied to root and uvicorn loggers.

Next:
- Extend masking to generic app logs (structured logging format with filters).
- UI masking for emails where appropriate.
