### Evidence P2-2.2: CI security scans

Added GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/security.yml` to run:
- Bandit static analysis for backend
- pip-audit on backend dependencies
- npm audit for frontend (prod deps)
- Trivy filesystem scan, failing on HIGH/CRITICAL

Acceptance: CI fails the PR if high/critical findings are present.
