### Evidence P1-1.4: Security headers and CSP

Implemented at app layer:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Strict-Transport-Security: set when HTTPS

Recommended at edge (Render proxy / CDN):
- Content-Security-Policy (start in report-only) with script-src 'self' and allowed CDNs as needed.

Runbook:
1) In Render, open the frontend service -> Settings -> Headers -> Add Response Header:
   - Name: Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only
   - Value: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://accounts.google.com https://apis.google.com https://cdn.lawpay.com https://secure.lawpay.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://secure.lawpay.com; img-src 'self' data: https:; frame-ancestors 'none'; frame-src 'self' https://secure.lawpay.com https://www.youtube.com https://www.youtube-nocookie.com https://youtube.com https://drive.google.com https://docs.google.com; connect-src 'self' https://secure.lawpay.com https://cdn.lawpay.com https://agentiq-vfo-backend.onrender.com https://accounts.google.com https://apis.google.com; upgrade-insecure-requests
2) Use the app normally and watch Render logs/DevTools for CSP reports/violations.
3) Update the value to enforce CSP (change to Content-Security-Policy) once violations are addressed.
