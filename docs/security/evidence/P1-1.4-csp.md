### Evidence P1-1.4: Security headers and CSP

Implemented at app layer:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Strict-Transport-Security: set when HTTPS

Recommended at edge (Render proxy / CDN):
- Content-Security-Policy (start in report-only) with script-src 'self' and allowed CDNs as needed.

Runbook:
1) Add CSP report-only at edge; monitor violations.
2) Whitelist required sources; then enable enforcing CSP.
